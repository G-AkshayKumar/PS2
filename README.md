# MSME Export Certification Validation System

## Project Overview
The MSME Export Certification Validation System, "Merge & Match," is designed to revolutionize the export certification process for Indian MSMEs. The platform aims to simplify certification acquisition, ensure document authenticity, and match exporters with trusted certification agencies.

## Problem Statement
MSMEs face significant challenges due to a lack of awareness, absence of a centralized certification platform, and inefficient matching of certifications. This platform addresses these problems by offering:

- **Centralized Certification Database**: A consolidated repository of export certification requirements.
- **Advanced Search and Matching Algorithms**: AI-powered recommendations and exporter-agency matching.
- **Fraud Detection Tools**: AI and blockchain-powered certificate validation.

## Current Progress

### 1. **Database Development**
- **trade_docs_DB**: Contains exported certification data stored in SQL DB.

### 2. **User Interface (UI)**
- **db_UI**: Basic demo UI displaying export certification details.
- **Webpage**: Centralized platform integrating database and UI components.

### 3. **Fraud Detection Module**
- **fraud_detection**: Establishes fraud detection for certificate validation.

*Note: All components mentioned above are incomplete and under active development.*
